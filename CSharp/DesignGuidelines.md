# Class Design Guidelines
1. A class/interface should have a single purpose
2. Only create a constructor that returns a useful object
3. An interface should be small and focused
4. Use an interface rather than a base class to support multiple implementations
5. Use an interface to decouple classes from each other
6. Avoid static classes
7. Don't hide inherited members with the new keyword
8. It should be possible to treat a derived object as if it were a base class object
9. Don't refer to derived classes from the base class
10. Avoid exposing the other objects an object depends on
11. Classes should have state and behavior
