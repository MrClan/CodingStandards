# General Suggestions

* Do not create declarations that vary only by capitalization.
* Do not use names that begin with a numeric character.
* Do add numeric suffixes to identifier names.
* Always choose meaningful and specific names.
* Always err on the side of verbosity not terseness.
* Variables and Properties should describe an entity not the type or size.
* Avoid using abbreviations unless the full name is excessive.
* Avoid abbreviations longer than 5 characters.
* Avoid naming conflicts with existing .NET Framework namespaces, or types.
* Name methods using verb-object pair. Eg. ShowDialog()
* Methods with return values should have a name describing the value returned. Eg. GetObjectState()
* Use descriptive variable names. Avoid single character variable names such as i or t. Use index or temp instead. 
* Do not abbreviate words. Use number instead of num.
* Use meaningful namespaces such as product name or company name.
